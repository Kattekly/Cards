Cards training
Learning with cards. We see a question - one side of the card with an unfamiliar word or definition. We then try to find the answer on our own and, if we fail, we open the back side and check ourselves. In essence, each viewing of a stack of cards is a small personal exam, a test of knowledge. During such a test, information is absorbed better than in simple reading.

You can create your own study cards in the app and share them with other students. You can decorate the cards with pictures.
