# Cards training

When we collect the answer ourselves and generate it, the brain works more actively. That is why everything we have
spoken and imagined is remembered better than what we have just seen and heard.

This principle is the basis of learning with cards. We see a question - one side of the card with an unfamiliar word or
definition. We then try to find the answer on our own and, if we fail, we open the back side and check ourselves. In
essence, each viewing of a stack of cards is a small personal exam, a test of knowledge. During such a test, information
is absorbed better than in simple reading.

You can create your own study cards in the app and share them with other students. You can decorate the cards with
pictures.
